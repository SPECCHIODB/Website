# specchio.ch Website

This is the source-code to the specchio website. We use the
Static-Site-Generator [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to generate the
site from markdown files. 

## Template

The theme for this website uses the [bulma](https://bulma.io/) css framework and
a custom template for VuePress. 

The Theme and all configuration can be found in
[src/.vuepress/theme](src/.vuepress/theme).
