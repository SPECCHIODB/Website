# Downloads

On this page you will find all Downloadables from the SPECCHIO project.

### SPECCHIO Application Download 

The SPECCHIO Application consists of a Java application plus a number of library
files. 

For MacOS we recommend the specific MacOS installer including the JRE for easiest install: [specchio-installer_MacOS.jar](https://jenkins.specchio.ch/job/SPECCHIO/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/src/MacOS_Installer/build/distributions/specchio-installer_MacOS.jar).

For generic operating systems we recommend using the multi-platform installer: [specchio-installer.jar](https://jenkins.specchio.ch/job/SPECCHIO/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/src/client/build/distributions/specchio-installer.jar).

The SPECCHIO client and server binaries are also available as ZIP archives. 

Details about the operation of SPECCHIO can be found in the respective 
[User Guides](/guides/).


### SPECCHIO Virtual Machine Download 

The SPECCHIO Virtualbox is a complete SPECCHIO server and client installed under
a virtual CentOS 7 installation using 
[Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). 

Please read the [SPECCHIO VM](https://github.com/SPECCHIODB/Guides/raw/master/SPECCHIO_VM.pdf) guide to learn more about installation and use.

#### Intended audience

SPECCHIO users who want to run the full system locally, either on their personal

well.
