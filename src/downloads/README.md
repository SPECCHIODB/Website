### SPECCHIO Application Download 

The SPECCHIO Application consists of a Java application plus a number of library
files. The files are bundled within a ZIP archive which are named according to
the version of the SPECCHIO application. Details about the features contained in
the different versions can be found in the respective 
[User Guides](/guides/).


### SPECCHIO Virtual Machine Download 

The SPECCHIO Virtualbox is a complete SPECCHIO server and client installed under
a virtual CentOS 6.4 or CentOS 7 installation using 
[Oracle Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). 

#### Intended audience
SPECCHIO users who want to run the full system locally, either on their personal
machines or on a server at their own institution and who do not want to go
through the hassle of a full system installation themselves. The SPECCHIO VM can
be configured to be accessible from the host system or from external machines as
well.
